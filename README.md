Fault slip model.

The jupyter notebook provides single fault slip model using InSAR data. Sample data is uploaded. You may need to have few library and python modules like numpy, scipy and matplotlib as well as okada_wrapper module which is available at https://github.com/tbenthompson/okada_wrapper. The inversion is applied and strike-slip and dip-slip were estimated for each patch of the given fault. More information is included in the notebook.
